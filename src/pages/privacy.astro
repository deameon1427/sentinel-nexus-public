        <div id="what-we-collect" class="policy-section">
          <h2><span class="section-num">2</span> What We Collect and Why</h2>

          <h3>2.1 Contact Form Submissions</h3>
          <p>When you submit a contact inquiry through our website, we collect:</p>
          <table class="data-table">
            <thead>
              <tr><th>Field</th><th>Required</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>Full name</td><td>Yes</td><td>To address you correctly in our response</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Email address</td><td>Yes</td><td>To reply to your inquiry</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Phone number</td><td>No</td><td>Alternative contact method if you prefer a call</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>This data is transmitted via an encrypted connection (HTTPS) to our self-hosted automation infrastructure (<code>n8n.sentinel-nexus.com</code>) for routing and response management. It is not transmitted to any third-party CRM or marketing platform.</p>

          <h3>2.2 Analytics Data</h3>
          <p>We use <strong>Umami Analytics</strong>, a self-hosted, open-source analytics platform. Umami is specifically designed to be GDPR-compliant without requiring a cookie consent banner because:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It does not use cookies or local storage.</li>
            <li>It does not collect personal data or persistent identifiers.</li>
            <li>IP addresses are never stored — they are used only transiently to derive an approximate country, then discarded.</li>
            <li>All analytics data is hosted on our own infrastructure within the EU.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The data collected includes: page views, referrer domain (not full URL), browser type, device type, OS type, and country. None of this constitutes personal data under GDPR.</p>

          <h3>2.3 Server Logs</h3>
          <p>Our web server infrastructure may retain standard access logs (IP address, request path, timestamp, user agent) for up to <strong>7 days</strong> for security and abuse-prevention purposes. These logs are not linked to any other personal data and are not used for profiling.</p>
        </div>

          <h2><span class="section-num">3</span> Legal Basis for Processing</h2>

We have conducted a legitimate interest assessment (LIA) and determined that our interest in responding to inbound inquiries is not overridden by your fundamental rights, given the minimal data involved and your direct initiation of the contact.</p>

            <div class="basis-card">
              <h4>Legitimate Interest <small>(Art. 6(1)(f))</small></h4>

          <h2><span class="section-num">5</span> Third Parties and Data Processors</h2>
          <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or broker your personal data to any third party. Below is a complete inventory of external services this site interacts with:</p>

          <div class="vendor-card">
            <div class="vendor-header">
              <span class="vendor-name">Google Fonts API</span>
              <span class="vendor-type vendor-external">External — Google LLC</span>
            </div>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Loads the Inter typeface from Google's CDN (<code>fonts.googleapis.com</code> and <code>fonts.gstatic.com</code>). When your browser requests the font, Google's servers receive your IP address and a <code>User-Agent</code> header.</p>
            <p><strong>What Google says it does with this:</strong> According to Google's own documentation, IP addresses from Font API requests are not stored beyond the immediate request and are not used for profiling. However, as an external third party we cannot independently verify this.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interest in providing a consistent visual experience. We acknowledge this constitutes a transfer of technical metadata to a US-based processor.</p>
            <p><strong>Safeguard:</strong> Google LLC participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). Standard Contractual Clauses also apply via Google's terms.</p>
            <p class="note-block"><strong>Our stance:</strong> We are evaluating self-hosting the Inter font to eliminate this external dependency entirely. We disclose it now in the spirit of full transparency.</p>

          <p>There are no advertising networks, retargeting pixels, social media SDKs, session recording tools, heatmap services, or third-party chat widgets on this site.</p>

            <strong>This website does not use cookies.</strong>
          </div>
          <p>Umami Analytics is specifically engineered to operate without cookies or any form of persistent browser storage. We do not set first-party cookies for analytics, session tracking, personalisation, or any other purpose.</p>
          <p>Google Fonts may cause your browser to cache font files locally — this is standard browser caching behaviour and is not a cookie or tracking mechanism.</p>
          <p>Because we do not use cookies, no cookie consent banner is required or shown. This is an intentional design decision.</p>

          <p>Our primary infrastructure is hosted within the EU/EEA. The only transfer of any data outside the EEA occurs when your browser loads fonts from Google's CDN (see Section 5 above).</p>
          <p>This transfer is covered by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google LLC's participation in the <strong>EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF)</strong>, certified July 2023.</li>
