- Build credibility through specific, measurable outcomes
- Help prospects envision similar results for their organization
- Showcase Sentinel Nexus expertise in action
- Provide reference material for sales conversations

## Structure

Follow this structure precisely:

### 1. The Challenge (150-200 words)
- What business problem did the client face?
- What was the impact of this problem (cost, time, risk)?
- What constraints or complications existed?
- Why hadn't they solved it already?

### 2. The Approach (150-200 words)
- How did Sentinel Nexus assess the situation?
- What solution strategy was developed?
- Why was this approach chosen over alternatives?
- What frameworks or methodologies were applied?

### 3. Implementation (200-250 words)

- Change management approach

### 4. Results (150-200 words)
- Primary metric with context

- Qualitative outcomes (adoption, satisfaction)
- Timeline to achieve results
- Ongoing benefits

### 5. Key Takeaways (100-150 words)
- What made this engagement successful
- Insights applicable to similar projects
- Lessons learned

## Tone Guidelines

- **Evidence-based**: Every claim should be supported by specifics
- **Confident but not boastful**: Let results speak for themselves
- **Professional**: This is business documentation, not marketing fluff
- **Accessible**: Technical enough to be credible, clear enough for executives

## Writing Rules

- Use past tense for completed actions
- Maintain client confidentiality - use descriptors like "a regional healthcare network" not real names
- Include specific numbers (percentages, dollar amounts, time periods)
- Avoid superlatives ("best," "revolutionary," "groundbreaking")
- No rhetorical questions
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)

## Metrics Guidelines

Metrics should be:
- Specific: "47% reduction" not "significant reduction"
- Relevant: Tied to the original challenge
- Credible: Achievable results, not exaggerated claims
- Varied: Mix of efficiency, cost, and quality metrics

Example metrics:
- "73% reduction in model deployment time"
- "6-week implementation from kickoff to production"
- "$1.2M annual cost savings from automated governance"
- "Zero compliance findings in subsequent audit"
- "94% user adoption within 30 days"

## Framework References

Reference these when relevant:
- NIST AI RMF for risk management
- EU AI Act for compliance work
- ISO 42001 for management systems
- MLOps best practices for implementation
- OWASP for security considerations

## Output Format

Return ONLY the markdown content body. Do NOT include:
- YAML frontmatter (handled separately)
- The title as an H1 (rendered from frontmatter)
- The metrics boxes (rendered from frontmatter)

Start with "## The Challenge" and follow the structure above.

## Client Quote (Optional)

If including a client quote, make it:
- Specific to the outcome achieved
- Realistic in tone and language
- Attributed to a role, not a name: "— VP of Data Science"

Example:
"We went from months of governance discussions to a working framework in six weeks. The Sentinel Nexus team understood our constraints and delivered a solution our board could actually endorse." — Chief Data Officer

## Remember

- This is a reference document, not a sales pitch
- Specificity builds credibility
- Results matter more than process descriptions
- Respect confidentiality absolutely
- The reader should finish thinking "They could do this for us"
